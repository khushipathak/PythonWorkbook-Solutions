The total amount of energy required to raise m grams of a material by $\\delta T$ degrees Celsius can be computed using the formula: $$ q = mc\\delta T$$Write a program that reads the mass of some water and the temperature change from the user. Your program should display the total amount of energy that must be added or removed to achieve the desired temperature change. Extend your program so that it also computes the cost of heating the water. Electricity is normally billed using units of kilowatt hours rather than Joules. In this exercise, you should assume that electricity costs 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour. Use your program to compute the cost of boiling water for a cup of coffee.\n",
